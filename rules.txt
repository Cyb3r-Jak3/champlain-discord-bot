**Welcome to the Official Discord for**:
- Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
- Champlain College Digital Forensics Association (DFA)
- Champlain Cyber Security Club (CCSC)
- Women in Technology Club (WiT)

This is a student-run Discord. All people who have the roles of moderator and/or leadership are students or former students. While professors may be on here, they donâ€™t control the discord and have limited access. Go to the #how-to-use channel to read how the server is set up and who has access to what.

The main rules for the server are below. This is a chilled-out environment so we don't ask much:
1) If you wouldn't say it in person, don't say it here.
2) Treat everyone with respect.
3) Don't be an asshole.
Hate speech such as (but not limited to) sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. comments will not be tolerated in this server in any channel.
If there is something that makes you uncomfortable please bring it to the attention of our {mod_role} or {leader_role} -- there is nothing too big or too small. We are still a part of the Champlain community.

If {mod_role} or {leader_role} has an issue with your post or has gotten reports about your post, there is a 3 strike policy:
Strike 1 - Warning message and a probable deletion on the post
Strike 2 - 1 week suspension (could be longer depending on the post and is at the discretion of {mod_role}/{leader_role})
Strike 3 - Banned from the server indefinitely

The focus of this discord is to create a computer focused community for Champlain students. Our fields overlap with many other fields including politics. Just remember to be courteous of others.

To get started:
1) Accept the rules by replying `?accept` to the Champlain-Management-Bot (check your Discord DMs)
2) change your nickname to your real first and last name for verification purposes
3) post in the #role-requests channel along with the role that matches who you are ({student_role}, {alumni_role}, or {professor_role})
